### A customized version of the Plast Pack resource pack!  
The Purpose of this texture pack is to fit my *own* style, and is fairly similar to my BetterDiscord theme [SimplyDark - Fuchsia Darkness](https://github.com/ToxxyTheTrash/SimplyDarkFuchsiaDarkness)

The texture pack supports and is **intended** to be used with Optifine.  
The texture pack works with all post-combat update Minecraft versions (v1.9.x-1.16.x)

### Notable changes to the texture pack:  
Darker stone-based blocks
